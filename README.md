# Coding Challenge

## Installation

Before you can get started and run the application, you'll first need to install the required dependencies. Navigate to this directory in your terminal, and run the command;

```shell
yarn
```

You can now start the application by running;

```shell
yarn start
```

This application uses hot module reloading to monitor the tasks directory, triggering a reload when a file is saved. Once you start this application, it might be helpful to keep it running off to the side. This way you can monitor changes to your files as their output is rendered into the application. It's important you don't change the name of the files, unless the task directs otherwise, as these files are strictly linked in the demo application.

## Getting Started

All the files you'll need to work on are located in the `./tasks` directory
